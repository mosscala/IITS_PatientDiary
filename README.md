Project repository for Introduction to IT Systems

# Project

Task #1.1
#What services do you want your application to provide? Why?

-display of appointments, medication, patient’s history of wellbeing, possibility to make entry about wellbeing/symptoms (for patients), possibility to make new entries for medication or appointments for medical staff, editing permission management.

#Who are the stakeholders? Do they have ideas on what the end-product should look like?

-medical staff and first and foremost patients

#Do you need to interview people or conduct surveys etc? If so, what is the targeted demographic and why?

-it is not necessary to conduct a survey or interviews. The targeted demographic are any patients capable of using a smartphone or laptop while hospitalised


#Are you going to involve users? If so, how do you plan to address issues such as ethics and data protection?

-data protection issue are definitely going to be addressed by getting the user's express permission before storing, saving and or sharing thier data. But it is unclear whether it will possible to solve those problems rather than just identifying them

#User stories: what are user expectations for your application?

-easy usability

Task #1.2: Timeline
In order to work on your project, you will need some plan on what is going to happen when, how, by whom.

#1. How long is the project timeline going to be? (The project timeline is the planned duration of the project,in terms of time needed to produce a finished product.)

- core product should preferably be ready until two weeks before project is due

#2. How hong is each phase of the project planned to last? Who should do what and when? How to deal with delays?

- We shall be working in sprints of 1 week and for each sprint, each of us will be focusing on specific features as scoped out in our tech spec. If there is a blocker to anyone of us, we shall combine efforts to solving the problem and seeking for help from the dev community.


#3. Who will be involved in the project? (e.g. Just the group members, external parties whom you consult,bodies or agencies you interview, or users you recruit to test and evaluate the product?)

- We will largely be the chair for this project; the fullstack of product will be speced out, designed and built by us. Once the product is ready, we shall employ the services of a closed user group to help us stress test the product.


#4. What are the risks for the requirements gathering process? (e.g. Private information exposure, projectmember dropping out, …)
- There is a potential for us to miss out on a specific use case as we are unable to be present in the hospitals to walk through what the manual process today is like

#5. What is the ultimate goal of the project and what is needed to achieve the goal? (e.g. software platforms,learning a new language, work arounds etc.)

-it is necessary to learn the flask framework in python, as well as the dash by plotly, and jinja framework for python. Additionally some html will be required as well as git for version control and PostgreSQL for database management


#6. Agree on who is going to be the project manager and what the role of this person will be
